# Summer program: Machine Learning - Handwritten number classification

##### The aim of this project is to let a high school student to get the first expericece of maching learning application.

##### This is a real world problem, sometimes we have handwrite numbers, like phone numbers, like credit card number. It is a tedious work to type those numbers on keyboard, to input into the computer. Now we want to build a machine learning model, which can recognize the vague handwritten numbers, and automatically change it to digital numbers.

## Learning Goals
1. Learn the basic concepts about machine learning: dataset, model, training, predicting, and the metrics to evaluate the performace of a maching learning model.
2. Learn how to train a machine learning model by Python + Scikit Learn.
3. Learn the basic principle of several classical machine learning algorithms, such as SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random forest, etc.
4. Learn how to compare the classification result by human-readable plot, by using matplotlib.

## Expected Result
1. Given the data set from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_digits.html#sklearn.datasets.load_digits , train a machine learning model based on the testset, and do a prediction on the testset.
2. Compare the results of different machine learning algorithms on this task. Which one is the most accurate? Which one is the fastest in training and which one is the fastest in predicting?
3. Using matplotlib, draw above comparison into graphs/plots.

## Timeline
#### Week1: Install the python IDE on macbook, download the dependency libraries by pip, get the basic knowledge of machine learning, we don't need to dig into the mathematical principle of an algorithm, but we need to know how usually do we train a model, how to use it to predict stuffs.
#### Week2: Implement a machine learning classification solution using SVM, train it on the giving dataset, and use it to predict the handwritten numbers.
#### Week3: Try other machine learning solutions by the scikit-learn framework, and compare them to see which one is the best in precision and performance.
#### Week4: Using matplotlib to draw a plot of the comparisons, to make the data visible beautifully, this is the basic skill of a researcher.
